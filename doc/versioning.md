## JVM Versioning Support

This library is intended to be used as a interface for reading and writing class files. As such, both the `Serializer` and `Deserialzier` will support the latest JVM version available. 
The onus of ensuring that the feature-set matches the correct JVM version as well as providing versioning metadata is on higher-level client (such aas `phoron_asm`).
